Thanks for using Comkube.

Try deploying a Compose test app with

```
kubectl apply --filename=- <<'EOF'
{{ .Files.Get "example-compose-app.yaml" -}}
EOF
```

This should create a Kubernetes service called `greet`, backed by a deployment
of the same name (see `kubectl get all`).

For debugging, show the controller logs by running

```
kubectl logs deployment/{{ .helpers.fullName }}
```

When done testing, delete the Compose test app including its owned objects with

```
kubectl delete composeapp foo
```

See the documentation at https://github.com/evolutics/comkube for more.
